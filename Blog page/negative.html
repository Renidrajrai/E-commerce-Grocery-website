        <p style="font-size: 20px; width:95%; padding-left : 15px; line-height: 30PX;">As we all know nothing is 100 percent good in our lives if there is something good there is something bad. Similarly, as there are good aspects of technology there are some negative impacts as well some of the negative aspects of technology are:</p>
        <p style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 30px; padding-left: 15px;">Prone to scams:</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; width:95%; padding-left : 15px;line-height: 30px;">As the rise of online shopping is reaching its peak there is also the rise of scams that are happening. many online store pages claim to have this product or this product but when they are delivered they are fake products or the quality of the product doesn't match the description the main type of scam is money laundering it is one of the most prevalent in the online sector. Many online stores claim to not have cash on delivery but have online payments and when they get the payment online they disappear or block them. So this is one of the negative impacts brought by the technology.</p>
        <p style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 30px; padding-left: 15px;">Has made us lazy:</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; width:95%; padding-left : 15px;line-height: 30px;">Another negative impact of technology is that it has made us lazy and has made us too dependent upon technology. Many people don’t even go out of their houses for anything, if they need anything they can just tap it away and the food or anything that they want will be on their doorstep. Due to the fact that they don’t leave their house, it has also made them move less which has caused them to be unhealthy. This has also caused a bit of social awkwardness in people and later having problems even talking with people, so on top of making us lazy it has also made us unhealthy and socially awkward so technology is not all good if we look it in that way.</p>
        <p style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 30px; padding-left: 15px;">Cybersecurity risk:</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; width:95%; padding-left : 15px;line-height: 30px;">Technology has become the main aspect of the grocery store. Another main problem that arises is the risk of cybersecurity. It mainly depends upon what type of security that you are using and the way you are using. One of the main problems is the theft of sensitive Customer information and financial data which may lead to financial losses and reputational damage of the store which may lead to a huge damage to the store because reputation is what gets people to buy through your store.</p>
